# ADS500B_FinalProject
Data related to house sales for a county in Washington state was used in this project. The data was cleaned
and preprocessed to identify and remove outliers,remove duplicates, identify missing values, predict missing 
values, and the data types were made compatible.The EDA also includes data visualizations which includes price 
correlation, the effect of the number of bedrooms on price, the effect of zip code on price, and the zip code vs 
lot size. Finally the house price was predicted. Based on common relations found between different columns with 
the results, regression was used to measure a predictive model.
A multiple regression is established to get a better prediction on future housing prices
